You are a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) expert. Your answers always need to follow the following output format and you always have to try to provide a LTL formula. You may repeat your answers.
Translate the following natural language sentences into an LTL formula and explain your translation step by step.
Remember that X means "next", U means "until", G means "globally", F means "finally", which means GF means "infinitely often". Parentheses specify the precedence of operators and group subformulas together.
The formula should only contain atomic propositions, operators, and parentheses: |, &, !, ->, <->, X, U, G, F, (, ).

Natural Language: Globally if a holds then c is true until b.
Explanation dictionary: {"a holds" : "a", "c is true until b" : "c U b", "if a holds then c is true until b" : "a -> c U b", "Globally" : "G"}
So the final LTL translation is: G (a -> (c U b)).FINISH

Natural Language: If b holds then, in the next step, c holds until a holds or always c holds.
Explanation dictionary: {"If SUB_EXPR_1, next , SUB_EXPR_2 until SUB_EXPR_3 or SUB_EXPR_4" : "G(SUB_EXPR_1 -> X (SUB_EXPR_2 U SUB_EXPR_3 || SUB_EXPR_4))", "If SUB_EXPR_1  SUB_EXPR_2": "G(SUB_EXPR_1 -> SUB_EXPR_2)", "SUB_EXPR_1  until SUB_EXPR_2 " : "SUB_EXPR_1 U SUB_EXPR_2"}
So the final LTL translation is: G(b->X((cUa)||Gc)).FINISH

Natural Language: If it is the case that every a is eventually followed by a b, then c needs to holds infinitely often.
Explanation dictionary: {"IF SUB_EXPR_1 eventually followed by SUB_EXPR_2, then SUB_EXPR_3" : "G (SUB_EXPR_1 -> F SUB_EXPR_2) -> SUB_EXPR_3", "it is the case that every SUB_EXPR_1 is eventually followed by SUB_EXPR_2" : "G(SUB_EXPR_1 -> F SUB_EXPR_2)", "SUB_EXPR needs to holds infinitely often" : "GF SUB_EXPR"}
So the final LTL translation is: G(a->Fb)->GFc.FINISH

Natural Language: If a holds b will eventually hold.
Explanation dictionary: {"IF SUB_EXPR_1  SUB_EXPR_2 eventually" : "G (SUB_EXPR_1 -> F SUB_EXPR_2)"}
So the final LTL translation is: G(a->Fb).FINISH

Natural Language: a can only hold every three timestamps.
Explanation dictionary: {"SUB_EXPR only every three timestamps": "G ( SUB_EXPR -> (X !SUB_EXPR || XX !SUB_EXPR || XXX !SUB_EXPR))"}
So the final LTL translation is: G ( a -> (X !a || XX !a || XXX !a)).FINISH

Natural Language: a holds in every fourth step.
Explanation dictionary: {"SUB_EXPR in every three step": "SUB_EXPR && G(SUB_EXPR-> X!SUB_EXPR && XX! SUB_EXPR && XXX! SUB_EXPR && XXXX SUB_EXPR)"}
So the final LTL translation is: a && G(a->X!a && XX!a && XXX!a && XXXXa).FINISH

Natural Language: a holds in every second step.
Explanation dictionary: {"SUB_EXPR in every second step": "SUB_EXPR && G(SUB_EXPR-> X!SUB_EXPR && XX SUB_EXPR)"}
So the final LTL translation is: a && G(a->X!a && XXa).FINISH

Natural Language: Whenever a is enabled, b is enabled three steps later.
Explanation dictionary: {"Whenever SUB_EXPR_1, SUB_EXPR_2": "G(SUB_EXPR_1 -> SUB_EXPR_2)" ,"a is enabled" : "a", "b is enabled three steps later" : "X(X(Xb))"}
So the final LTL translation is: G(a->X(X(Xb))).FINISH

Natural Language: not a holds at most two timestamps.
Explanation dictionary: {"not SUB_EXPR at most two timestamps": "!G(!( SUB_EXPR && X SUB_EXPR))"}
So the final LTL translation is: !G(!(a&&Xa)).FINISH

Natural Language: a must always hold, but if is execeeds, it allow two timestamps to recover.
Explanation dictionary: {"always SUB_EXPR, but if execeeds, two timestamps to recover ": "!G(!( SUB_EXPR && X SUB_EXPR))"}
So the final LTL translation is: !G(!(a&&Xa)).FINISH

Natural Language: Whenever a holds, b must hold in the next two steps.
Explanation dictionary: {"Whenever SUB_EXPR_1 , SUB_EXPR_2": "G(SUB_EXPR_1 -> SUB_EXPR_2)", " SUB_EXPR must hold in the next two steps": "SUB_EXPR || X SUB_EXPR"}
So the final LTL translation is: G(a->(b||Xb)).FINISH

Natural Language: Once a happened, b won't happen again.
Explanation dictionary: {"Once SUB_EXPR_1 , won't SUB_EXPR_2": "G(SUB_EXPR_1 -> XG!SUB_EXPR_2)", "Once SUB_EXPR_1 ,  SUB_EXPR_2": "G(SUB_EXPR_1 -> SUB_EXPR_2)","won't SUB_EXPR_2": "XG!SUB_EXPR_2"}
So the final LTL translation is: G(a->XG!b).FINISH


Natural Language: a can only happen if b happend before.
Explanation dictionary: {"SUB_EXPR_1 only if SUB_EXPR_2 before": "(!SUB_EXPR_1) U SUB_EXPR_1"}
So the final LTL translation is: (!a)Ub.FINISH

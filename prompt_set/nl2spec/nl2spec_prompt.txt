You are a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) expert. Your answers always need to follow the following output format and you always have to try to provide a LTL formula. You may repeat your answers.
Translate the following natural language sentences into an LTL formula and explain your translation step by step.
Remember that X means "next", U means "until", G means "globally", F means "finally", which means GF means "infinitely often".
The formula should only contain atomic propositions or operators |, &, ~, ->, <->, X, U, G, F.
Natural Language: Every a is eventually followed by a e.
Given translations: {}
Explanation: "Every" from the input sentence refers to the temporal operator "G", meaning that the subsequent part of the input must hold at every point in time, i.e., globally.
"eventually" from the input sentence translates to the temporal operator "F". "a followed by a e" means that after "a" holds, "e" has to hold as well, i.e., translating to an implication.
Thus, "a eventually followed by a e" translates to "a -> F e".
Explanation dictionary: {"Every": "G", "eventually": "F", "a": "a", "e": "e", "a followed by a e": "a -> e", "a eventually followed by a e": "a -> F e"}
So the final LTL translation is: G (a -> F e).FINISH
Natural Language: a and b never occur at the same time but one of them holds in every time step.
Given translations: {}
Explanation: "a and b" from the input translates to the conjunction of atomic propositions a,b, i.e., it translates to "a & b".
"a and b never occur" from the input translates to the temporal behavior that at all positions, i.e., globally, neither a nor b hold, i.e., "G(~(a & b))".
The input additionally requires that "one of them holds in every time step", which means that a or b hold globally, i.e., it translates to "G(a | b)".
Explanation dictionary: {"a and b": "a & b", "a and b never occur": "G(~(a & b))", "one of them holds in every time step": "G(a | b)"}
So the final LTL translation is: G(~(a & b)) & G(a | b).FINISH
Natural language: a can only happen if b happend before.
Given translations: {}
Explanation: "if b happend before" from the input means that until some point b will happen, i.e., it translates to "U b" and "a can only happen", means that a is not allowed to hold, i.e., it translates to "~ a".
In combination, this sentence represents that something should not happen until a certain event happens, in this case a is not allowed to hold until b holds.
Explanation dictionary: {"if b happend before": "U b", "a can only happen": "~ a"}
So the final LTL translation is: (~ a) U b.FINISH
Natural language: a holds until b holds or always a holds.
Given translations: {}
Explanation: "a holds until b holds" from the input translates to the temporal modality "a U b" and "or" from the input translates to the operator "|".
"always a holds" from the input means that globally a holds, i.e., it translates to "G a".
Explanation dictionary: {"a holds until b holds": "a U b", "or": "|", "always a holds": "G a"}
So the final LTL translation is: (a U b) | G a.FINISH

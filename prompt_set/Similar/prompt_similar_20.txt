You are a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) expert. Your answers always need to follow the following output format and you always have to try to provide a LTL formula. You may repeat your answers.
Translate the following natural language sentences into an LTL formula and explain your translation step by step.
Remember that X means 'next', U means 'until', G means 'globally', F means 'finally', which means GF means 'infinitely often'. Parentheses specify the precedence of operators and group subformulas together.
The formula should only contain atomic propositions, operators, and parentheses: |, &, !, ->, <->, X, U, G, F, (, ).

***MUST answer in this format:***
[
Explanation dictionary:
So the final LTL translation is: 
]

Examples:

INPUT
Natural Language: a and b never occur at the same time but one of them holds in every time step.
OUPUT
Explanation dictionary: {"a and b": "a & b", "a and b never occur": "G(~(a & b))", "one of them holds in every time step": "G(a | b)"}
So the final LTL translation is: G(~(a & b)) & G(a | b).FINISH

INPUT
Natural Language: Every a is eventually followed by a e.
OUPUT
Explanation dictionary: {"Every": "G", "eventually": "F", "a": "a", "e": "e", "a followed by a e": "a -> e", "a eventually followed by a e": "a -> F e"}
So the final LTL translation is: G (a -> F e).FINISH
